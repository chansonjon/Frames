<h1>Welcome to Frames</h1>

<p>
	Frames is a small, compact Javascript MVC framework intended for small to medium sized projects. Frames was inspired by some of the simpler routing conventions found in Ruby on Rails and CakePHP. Everything in Frames is driven off of the Controller/Action notion which is auto routed via the URL.
</p>
<p>
	For example, imagine the following Frames URL was executed: http://localhost.com/#!/gallery/flickr/tag:sunset/
</p>

<h2>Why Frames? Why Another JS Framework?</h2>

<p>
	Mostly because I wanted to build one.
